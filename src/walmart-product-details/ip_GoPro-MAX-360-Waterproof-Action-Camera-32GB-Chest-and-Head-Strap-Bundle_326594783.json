Using opposite side lenses, the MAX can capture everything that happens in a 360° view in up to 4992 x 2496 resolution video and 5760 x 2880 still photos. Both photos and video are automatically stitched in the camera for editing flexibility and easy sharing. It can also use only one lens to capture traditional GoPro HERO-style wide-angle action footage when needed.\n\nThe MAX supports multiple modes for creative video and photos, which can take 270° still photos without distortion. TimeWarp mode allows you to record in standard HERO mode with a variable speed function; you can slow down then speed up your footage in real time with one tap. The MAX supports the HEVC video format which records very small files while preserving image quality, saving you precious space on your SD card.\n\nThere are four lens sizes to choose from for just the right angle: Narrow, Linear, Wide, and Max SuperView for those extremely wide shots. To complement the camera's spherical video, spherical audio is also recorded. Using six microphones, you can record sounds from all directions, creating a totally immersive 360° surround-sound video playback experience.","usItemId":"326594783","offerId":"DC9E1BB0565C414D8B9CB084FFC30818","fulfillmentBadge":null,"checkAvailabilityGlobalDFS":false,"variantProductIdMap":{},"orderMinLimit":1,"discounts":null,"displayOfferLevelImage":false,"sellerAverageRating":4.1286,"preownedCondition":"New","tireSpeedRating":null,"fsaEligibleInd":false,"externalInfo":null,"subscriptionEligible":false,"wfsProviderName":null,"suppressReviews":false,"pickupOption":{"accessTypes":[],"availabilityStatus":null,"slaTier":null,"storeId":null,"storeName":null},"rhPath":"20000:21000:21004:21121:21326","variantCriteria":[],"classType":"REGULAR","annualEvent":false,"itemType":null,"sellerName":"Power Photo Corp","priceInfo":{"capType":null,"comparisonPrice":null,"currentPrice":{"bestValue":null,"currencyUnit":"USD","price":419.95,"priceDisplay":"$419.95","priceString":"$419.95","variantPriceString":"$419.95"},"isPriceReduced":false,"listPrice":null,"priceDisplayCodes":{"clearance":null,"eligibleForAssociateDiscount":null,"finalCostByWeight":null,"priceDisplayCondition":null,"reducedPrice":null,"rollback":null,"submapType":null},"priceRange":{"currencyUnit":null,"denominations":null,"maxPrice":null,"minPrice":null,"priceString":null},"priceReducedDisplay":null,"savings":null,"savingsAmount":null,"secondaryOfferBoost":null,"shipPrice":null,"subscriptionPrice":null,"unitPrice":null,"wPlusEarlyAccessPrice":null,"walmartFundedAmount":null,"wasPrice":null},"productTypeId":"2186","vision":{"ageGroup":null,"visionCenterApproved":false},"motorOilType":null,"location":{"addressId":null,"city":"Petersburg","intent":"SHIPPING","mpPickupLocation":null,"pickupLocation":{"accessPointId":null,"accessType":null,"storeId":"2696"},"postalCode":"26847","stateOrProvinceCode":"WV","storeIds":["2696"]},"earlyAccessEvent":false,"addOnServices":[{"groups":[{"assetUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/3-Year-Accident-Protection-Plan-For-Cameras-400-4999-99_b04b2969-4200-4781-9f3a-3da0ccca5d4d.06e6f536cfdbec82e8b0108a6488901d.jpeg","groupTitle":"Walmart Protection Plan by Allstate","groupType":"WPP","nearByStores":null,"services":[{"currentPrice":{"price":58,"priceString":"$58.00"},"displayName":"3-Year plan - $58.00","giftEligible":true,"name":"3-Year","offerId":"1ABD4CEFA3D64E45B0F830381DC1AB45","selectedDisplayName":"Walmart Protection Plan by Allstate - 3-Year","serviceMetaData":null,"usItemId":"485965656"},{"currentPrice":{"price":77,"priceString":"$77.00"},"displayName":"4-Year plan - $77.00","giftEligible":true,"name":"4-Year","offerId":"E38FD362971B4F9083047DF7EE2890D1","selectedDisplayName":"Walmart Protection Plan by Allstate - 4-Year","serviceMetaData":null,"usItemId":"581468105"}],"shortDescription":"<p>Get years of protection for just pennies a day.</p><p><b>Plan covers:</b></p><ul><li>Accidents like drops, spills, and cracks</li><li>Screen and Lens failure</li><li>Battery failure</li></ul><p><b>Plan includes:</b></p><ul><li>24/7 Customer Support</li><li>Easy Online Claims</li><li>Fast Repairs or Replacements</li></ul><p><b>Protect it today.
