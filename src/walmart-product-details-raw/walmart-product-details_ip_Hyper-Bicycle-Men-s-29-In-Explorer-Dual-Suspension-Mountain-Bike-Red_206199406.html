It is well built with a sturdy frame and quality parts. Compared to his older aluminum bike, this is a huge step up in quality. The ride is smooth on our black top drive way but you can definitely tell that it is ready for a much rougher terrain. The 29\" size is perfect for my almost 6' tall husband. The only downside to the bike was the instructions for putting it together. Most everything is already assembled except the wheels, handle bars, seat and pedals but for some reason we had a small problem with where the brake wires were actually supposed to go around the frame. The instructions wasn't exactly clear and we felt that they hung a little lower than they really should have. No real problem but I just wish we would have been more confident in knowing we got it together exactly as intended. But all in all we feel that this is an extremely nice, well built bike and definitely worth the price.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ShawnaB"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"Good Exercise","datePublished":"July 13, 2021","reviewBody":"I love my new bicycle! I had not been on a bike for about 30 years until I received this one, so it is incredible compared to what I used to ride. It was fast and simple to assemble from the large box it shipped in. You just need to install the front wheel, handlebars, pedals and insert the seat post into the frame. I did not have any issues assembling the bike by myself, and it only took about fifteen minutes to complete. Be sure and tighten every nut and bolt on the bike before you ride it! I needed to adjust the brakes after my first test ride but that was simple to do also. Make sure the wheels are turning smoothly and not rubbing against the brake pads! If it is, loosen the two screws and move the brakes until the disk is even between the pads and then tighten the screws back. If the brakes are not stopping good enough you can loosen the brake cable bolt and adjust to your braking preference. The brakes work great now stopping me no matter how fast I am going, and I can go very fast on this bike. I also put a little oil on the chain and moving parts. It is very smooth and quiet now. \r\n\r\nAfter assembling the bike I carefully inspected it and could only find a couple defects. The paint is chipped on the inside of the front fork and some paint was missing on the back of the steel seat post. Everything else was perfect. All of the welds on the attractive frame are perfection. The front part of the bike frame is made of aluminum with the back half being steel. There is a tiny bit of wobble to the wheels so I may try and true them better later on. I like how you shift the nine speeds up and down with your index finger and thumb, and there is a gear indicator. Mine seems to be adjusted okay out of the box, but there are adjustment screws if you need to fine tune it. I can shift through all the gears extremely fast without issue. I like the dual suspension also. It is smooth while riding downhill on rough terrain. I adjusted the back shock tighter since I am almost at the max weight capacity for the bike. The front fork suspension works fine for me but it would be better if it was easily adjustable like the back shock. The quick adjustable seat clamp is a nice touch. I did not think the small seat would be comfortable but surprisingly it is fine. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint is the fit. This bike is marketed for people six feet and up. I am over six feet and was afraid a 29 inch bike was going to be huge, but it is kind of small feeling. The seat post diameter is 27.2mm and is 250mm tall, with about three of those inches in the frame. I have the post at the minimum insertion mark, with the seat moved all the way back and my knees still feel cramped and a little out to the side while trying to pedal. The current seat height is great while coasting and going downhill, but I wish it was taller so I could stretch my legs out more while pedaling. I find myself needing to stand on the pedals while riding because my legs are feeling cramped. I contacted Hyper about this and they advised they do not sell taller seat posts, so I ordered a 350mm tall aftermarket model online for around ten dollars. Now I am comfortable and can pedal easier. I also ordered a bottle holder for a few dollars. This bike has the screws for the bottle holder in the frame, but nothing else is included.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a wonderful bike that could be even better with a few improvements. At the low price it is being sold at it is excellent. After riding it each day for the short time I have had it I am already feeling in better shape and breathing easier. The more I ride it the easier it is getting and the longer distances I can go. Instead of walking around the neighborhood I just hop on my bike and zip back and forth now. With a few tweaks, and maybe a few more dollars spent, this bike is awesome. For the good exercise, while having fun outdoors, it is five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"walmartfanman"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"Excellent","datePublished":"July 3, 2021","reviewBody":"I expected a lot but this is much more than I expected. I am in Florida so I won't be able to drive it on the mountains but only for the moment. Assemble it was easy with some skills and tools what I think every mountain biker has to have if not don't do in wilderness with bike. After assembling I took a test drive and then did some adjustments, and then again. Now it is how it is supposed to be. It is well built and sturdy, sturdier than I expected and I wouldn't be afraid to go way off road with it.

The bike is a beautiful red color and looks good. Riding is very smooth thanks to the 29 inch rims and full suspension. The gears are easy to shift and offer just the right speeds I need.

I thought this would be an affordable spare when I have friends who want to ride with me. This came needing some assembly. I've never put a bike together but was able to get it done fairly quickly with basic tools. It was packaged well although one of the pre-connected brake cables was routed incorrectly and required undoing it and reconnecting. Not a big deal overall. My initial impression was one of disappointment. The bike is pretty heavy. The front wheel was out of true. I don't have a spoke wrench so I resorted to the slam it on the ground sideways method. This got it mostly straight without any damage. The derailleur is plastic and needed adjustment as it kept jumping in and out of gear. The front brake needed adjustment right out of the box. I put it on a weight loss plan immediately. I removed all unnecessary items such as reflectors, kickstand, and all decals. Once I did all that I took it for a spin around the neighborhood. Had no issue. Next it was time for a local dirt greenway/trail. It actually performed well. The front and rear shocks are helpful to soak up bumps. The brakes work good enough but definitely aren't as good as the hydraulic brakes on my other bike. \r\n So I've come to the conclusion that this is a decent bike as long as you accept the fact that it's not a 1,600 bike. It is what it is. I'd recommend it for someone who only rides occasionally. Likes greenways, rail trails, or very mild mountain biking trails. They say it's for riders over 6'0 but I'm only 5'10\" and it feels just right. I actually had to raise the seat up. \r\n Some things I like about it. The 29\" wheels make it really easy to roll over tree roots and stuff. The disc brakes are much better than rim brakes. Plus it looks nice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"theadventurer"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"Hyper Mountain Bike 29 inches","datePublished":"August 9, 2020","reviewBody":"my husband assembled this bike and he said it was easy with the right tools. my husband is over 6 ft tall and this 29 in is a good height for him. however, my son who is 5ft 6in tall said this was too high for his own comfort. my husband enjoyed riding this bike. but when he placed it on high gear, it got stuck there. he said he would try to fix it. he is not really a diy person so maybe something went wrong with his assembly. good looking bike. he rides it mainly on uneven grass and sometimes on gravel and paved road","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ML"}},{"@type":"Review","name":"It does its job well enough","datePublished":"August 25, 2020","reviewBody":"This mountain bike works quite well for those just getting into mountain biking (it obviously isn't pro status). The gears are easy to shift, although it does seem like it takes several turns for the chain to catch up. It was missing at least the seat clamp upon arrival. The box was broken and all taped up so I assume it fell out. Customer service was a breeze and got a new one sent out to me fast, so 5 stars for that. However, the clamp doesn't seem right to me and looking into the bike where the seat inserts it still looks like it is missing something. But my dad got it to work for me anyways so oh well. I did attach a bike trailer to it and rode my kids around on the road no problem. Brakes seem to work well too. The wires for the brakes are very long and I will eventually end up trimming them. Set up was fairly easy too, it took me about 30 minutes. It unfortunately does not include instructions so it just took a little guesswork and fiddling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4,"bestRating":5},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"peretz12"}}],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":3.4,"bestRating":5,"reviewCount":269}}</script><script nonce="8gl2FdnDXBzPYU-r" type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"item":{"@type":"Thing","@id":"https://www.walmart.com/cp/sports-outdoors/4125","name":"Sports & Outdoors"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"item":{"@type":"Thing","@id":"https://www.walmart.com/cp/bikes/1081404","name":"Bikes"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"item":{"@type":"Thing","@id":"https://www.walmart.com/browse/sports-outdoors/adult-bikes/4125_1081404_1230089","name":"Adult Bikes"}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":4,"item":{"@type":"Thing","@id":"https://www.walmart.com/browse/sports-outdoors/adult-mountain-bikes/4125_1081404_1230089_2768744","name":"Adult Mountain Bikes"}}]}</script><link fetchpriority="auto" rel="preload" as="image" href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-137b/k2-_a59ce72b-2be2-4a0d-bd99-024f8b72f552.v1.jpg?odnHeight=132&amp;odnWidth=1560&amp;odnBg="/><link fetchpriority="auto" rel="preload" as="image" href="//i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/63fd9f59-e685/7e6c8c3a-3ba7-437a-a066-de3ad3a6a15a/v1/roundReturn.svg"/><link fetchpriority="auto" rel="preload" as="image" href="//i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/63fd9f59-3e1b/a3d2466d-fa02-4f2d-a401-aca52a4aac17/v1/walmartPlus-logo-blue.svg"/><link fetchpriority="high" rel="preload" as="image" href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/Hyper-Bicycles-Men-s-29-Explorer-Dual-Suspension-Mountain-Bike-Red_d885e90f-d5fa-4c8d-b79a-801ed6ae5bb2.38883fa729039ce5aaf1ffd4395718b7.jpeg?odnHeight=640&amp;odnWidth=640&amp;odnBg=FFFFFF"/><meta name="next-head-count" content="27"/><script nonce="8gl2FdnDXBzPYU-r">(()=>{

It is well built with a sturdy frame and quality parts. Compared to his older aluminum bike, this is a huge step up in quality. The ride is smooth on our black top drive way but you can definitely tell that it is ready for a much rougher terrain. The 29\" size is perfect for my almost 6' tall husband. The only downside to the bike was the instructions for putting it together. Most everything is already assembled except the wheels, handle bars, seat and pedals but for some reason we had a small problem with where the brake wires were actually supposed to go around the frame. The instructions wasn't exactly clear and we felt that they hung a little lower than they really should have. No real problem but I just wish we would have been more confident in knowing we got it together exactly as intended. But all in all we feel that this is an extremely nice, well built bike and definitely worth the price.","reviewTitle":"Well built bike but easy on the pocket","negativeFeedback":0,"positiveFeedback":2,"userNickname":"ShawnaB","media":[{"id":"c85af5aa-1a6f-4785-a56e-60ce3cc2eba3","reviewId":"3d042418-b6f5-54a7-9b3e-5076c800672a","mediaType":"IMAGE","normalUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6f39/k2-_27dfa5f3-ec5e-4ef7-8a07-ab8751556d49.v1.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6f39/k2-_27dfa5f3-ec5e-4ef7-8a07-ab8751556d49.v1.jpg?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff","caption":null,"rating":5},{"id":"f3b13834-121c-4c5e-a6d7-0ba5c7306ce9","reviewId":"3d042418-b6f5-54a7-9b3e-5076c800672a","mediaType":"IMAGE","normalUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1de2/k2-_c86c1b2a-f4ac-4716-9448-ff486ad84fb4.v1.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1de2/k2-_c86c1b2a-f4ac-4716-9448-ff486ad84fb4.v1.jpg?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff","caption":null,"rating":5}],"photos":[{"caption":null,"id":"c85af5aa-1a6f-4785-a56e-60ce3cc2eba3","sizes":{"normal":{"id":"normal","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6f39/k2-_27dfa5f3-ec5e-4ef7-8a07-ab8751556d49.v1.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"id":"thumbnail","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6f39/k2-_27dfa5f3-ec5e-4ef7-8a07-ab8751556d49.v1.jpg?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff"}}},{"caption":null,"id":"f3b13834-121c-4c5e-a6d7-0ba5c7306ce9","sizes":{"normal":{"id":"normal","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1de2/k2-_c86c1b2a-f4ac-4716-9448-ff486ad84fb4.v1.jpg"},"thumbnail":{"id":"thumbnail","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1de2/k2-_c86c1b2a-f4ac-4716-9448-ff486ad84fb4.v1.jpg?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff"}}}],"badges":[{"badgeType":"Custom","id":"IncentivizedReviewYes","contentType":"REVIEW","glassBadge":{"id":"IncentivizedReview","text":"Incentivized Review"}}],"clientResponses":[],"syndicationSource":null,"snippetFromTitle":null},{"reviewId":"265186372","rating":5,"reviewSubmissionTime":"7/13/2021","reviewText":"I love my new bicycle! I had not been on a bike for about 30 years until I received this one, so it is incredible compared to what I used to ride. It was fast and simple to assemble from the large box it shipped in. You just need to install the front wheel, handlebars, pedals and insert the seat post into the frame. I did not have any issues assembling the bike by myself, and it only took about fifteen minutes to complete. Be sure and tighten every nut and bolt on the bike before you ride it! I needed to adjust the brakes after my first test ride but that was simple to do also. Make sure the wheels are turning smoothly and not rubbing against the brake pads! If it is, loosen the two screws and move the brakes until the disk is even between the pads and then tighten the screws back. If the brakes are not stopping good enough you can loosen the brake cable bolt and adjust to your braking preference. The brakes work great now stopping me no matter how fast I am going, and I can go very fast on this bike. I also put a little oil on the chain and moving parts. It is very smooth and quiet now. \r\n\r\nAfter assembling the bike I carefully inspected it and could only find a couple defects. The paint is chipped on the inside of the front fork and some paint was missing on the back of the steel seat post. Everything else was perfect. All of the welds on the attractive frame are perfection. The front part of the bike frame is made of aluminum with the back half being steel. There is a tiny bit of wobble to the wheels so I may try and true them better later on. I like how you shift the nine speeds up and down with your index finger and thumb, and there is a gear indicator. Mine seems to be adjusted okay out of the box, but there are adjustment screws if you need to fine tune it. I can shift through all the gears extremely fast without issue. I like the dual suspension also. It is smooth while riding downhill on rough terrain. I adjusted the back shock tighter since I am almost at the max weight capacity for the bike. The front fork suspension works fine for me but it would be better if it was easily adjustable like the back shock. The quick adjustable seat clamp is a nice touch. I did not think the small seat would be comfortable but surprisingly it is fine. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint is the fit. This bike is marketed for people six feet and up. I am over six feet and was afraid a 29 inch bike was going to be huge, but it is kind of small feeling. The seat post diameter is 27.2mm and is 250mm tall, with about three of those inches in the frame. I have the post at the minimum insertion mark, with the seat moved all the way back and my knees still feel cramped and a little out to the side while trying to pedal. The current seat height is great while coasting and going downhill, but I wish it was taller so I could stretch my legs out more while pedaling. I find myself needing to stand on the pedals while riding because my legs are feeling cramped. I contacted Hyper about this and they advised they do not sell taller seat posts, so I ordered a 350mm tall aftermarket model online for around ten dollars. Now I am comfortable and can pedal easier. I also ordered a bottle holder for a few dollars. This bike has the screws for the bottle holder in the frame, but nothing else is included.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a wonderful bike that could be even better with a few improvements. At the low price it is being sold at it is excellent. After riding it each day for the short time I have had it I am already feeling in better shape and breathing easier. The more I ride it the easier it is getting and the longer distances I can go. Instead of walking around the neighborhood I just hop on my bike and zip back and forth now. With a few tweaks, and maybe a few more dollars spent, this bike is awesome. For the good exercise, while having fun outdoors, it is five stars.","reviewTitle":"Good Exercise","negativeFeedback":0,"positiveFeedback":2,"userNickname":"walmartfanman","media":[{"id":"ec71992d-095b-413f-bfd4-d7858fa343e6","reviewId":"62f847aa-3034-52e8-8470-38834bc90d2f","mediaType":"IMAGE","normalUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1017/k2-_aa5a8002-e9d7-414b-a874-f73801ea0b1c.v1.bin","thumbnailUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1017/k2-_aa5a8002-e9d7-414b-a874-f73801ea0b1c.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff","caption":null,"rating":5},{"id":"b19ddbb0-532e-4883-b645-fd84e60c64c0","reviewId":"62f847aa-3034-52e8-8470-38834bc90d2f","mediaType":"IMAGE","normalUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6a49/k2-_d5b6253d-2906-4065-9355-c9343461c701.v1.bin","thumbnailUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6a49/k2-_d5b6253d-2906-4065-9355-c9343461c701.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff","caption":null,"rating":5}],"photos":[{"caption":null,"id":"ec71992d-095b-413f-bfd4-d7858fa343e6","sizes":{"normal":{"id":"normal","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1017/k2-_aa5a8002-e9d7-414b-a874-f73801ea0b1c.v1.bin"},"thumbnail":{"id":"thumbnail","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-1017/k2-_aa5a8002-e9d7-414b-a874-f73801ea0b1c.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff"}}},{"caption":null,"id":"b19ddbb0-532e-4883-b645-fd84e60c64c0","sizes":{"normal":{"id":"normal","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6a49/k2-_d5b6253d-2906-4065-9355-c9343461c701.v1.bin"},"thumbnail":{"id":"thumbnail","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-6a49/k2-_d5b6253d-2906-4065-9355-c9343461c701.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff"}}}],"badges":[{"badgeType":"Custom","id":"IncentivizedReviewYes","contentType":"REVIEW","glassBadge":{"id":"IncentivizedReview","text":"Incentivized Review"}}],"clientResponses":[{"date":null,"department":null,"logoImage":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stratos-logos/logos/HyperBikes.jpeg","name":null,"response":"\nHi, Thank you so much for the 5 star review and detailed feedback on the Hyper 29\" Explorer Mountain Bike, I will pass on your comments to our team.

This bike is great , it has a beautiful red powder coat paint job and black wheels and handle bars.The bike also has front and back suspension which is really easy on my body. The front and rear disk brakes took some getting used to, but after some adjustments they work great.I ride a lot so i had to change out the narrow factory seat, and i added my phone mount, camera and mirrors. The nine speed seems to work better than my 21 speed, it is less complicated and easy to ride.

The bike is easy to assemble, it requires a few Allen wrenches, a phillips screwdriver, and a small crescent wrench. I had the bike assembled and ready to ride in less than an hour. The bike is a beautiful red color and looks good. Riding is very smooth thanks to the 29 inch rims and full suspension. The gears are easy to shift and offer just the right speeds I need. I took a 20 mile beach bike path ride and was amazed at how comfortable this bike was to ride.

I thought this would be an affordable spare when I have friends who want to ride with me. This came needing some assembly. I've never put a bike together but was able to get it done fairly quickly with basic tools. It was packaged well although one of the pre-connected brake cables was routed incorrectly and required undoing it and reconnecting. Not a big deal overall. My initial impression was one of disappointment. The bike is pretty heavy. The front wheel was out of true. I don't have a spoke wrench so I resorted to the slam it on the ground sideways method. This got it mostly straight without any damage. The derailleur is plastic and needed adjustment as it kept jumping in and out of gear. The front brake needed adjustment right out of the box. I put it on a weight loss plan immediately. I removed all unnecessary items such as reflectors, kickstand, and all decals. Once I did all that I took it for a spin around the neighborhood. Had no issue. Next it was time for a local dirt greenway/trail. It actually performed well. The front and rear shocks are helpful to soak up bumps. The brakes work good enough but definitely aren't as good as the hydraulic brakes on my other bike. \r\n So I've come to the conclusion that this is a decent bike as long as you accept the fact that it's not a 1,600 bike. It is what it is. I'd recommend it for someone who only rides occasionally. Likes greenways, rail trails, or very mild mountain biking trails. They say it's for riders over 6'0 but I'm only 5'10\" and it feels just right. I actually had to raise the seat up. \r\n Some things I like about it. The 29\" wheels make it really easy to roll over tree roots and stuff. The disc brakes are much better than rim brakes. Plus it looks nice.","reviewTitle":"Decent bike","negativeFeedback":0,"positiveFeedback":2,"userNickname":"theadventurer","media":[{"id":"872ab467-4139-4352-a03e-7088a8778da1","reviewId":"19acec84-7f0b-59a6-975a-048bcd760701","mediaType":"IMAGE","normalUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-5c88/k2-_a46a83a8-99dd-4b53-a0ed-1386fc5efe3c.v1.bin","thumbnailUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-5c88/k2-_a46a83a8-99dd-4b53-a0ed-1386fc5efe3c.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff","caption":null,"rating":4},{"id":"f7ad63b4-674b-4186-9cbd-0cdd1977eef9","reviewId":"19acec84-7f0b-59a6-975a-048bcd760701","mediaType":"IMAGE","normalUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-8531/k2-_7a19589e-ff69-4892-b78d-a1d35207cfb8.v1.bin","thumbnailUrl":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-8531/k2-_7a19589e-ff69-4892-b78d-a1d35207cfb8.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff","caption":null,"rating":4}],"photos":[{"caption":null,"id":"872ab467-4139-4352-a03e-7088a8778da1","sizes":{"normal":{"id":"normal","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-5c88/k2-_a46a83a8-99dd-4b53-a0ed-1386fc5efe3c.v1.bin"},"thumbnail":{"id":"thumbnail","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-5c88/k2-_a46a83a8-99dd-4b53-a0ed-1386fc5efe3c.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff"}}},{"caption":null,"id":"f7ad63b4-674b-4186-9cbd-0cdd1977eef9","sizes":{"normal":{"id":"normal","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-8531/k2-_7a19589e-ff69-4892-b78d-a1d35207cfb8.v1.bin"},"thumbnail":{"id":"thumbnail","url":"https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/6e29e393-8531/k2-_7a19589e-ff69-4892-b78d-a1d35207cfb8.v1.bin?odnWidth=150\u0026odnHeight=150\u0026odnBg=ffffff"}}}],"badges":[{"badgeType":"Custom","id":"IncentivizedReviewYes","contentType":"REVIEW","glassBadge":{"id":"IncentivizedReview","text":"Incentivized Review"}}],"clientResponses":[{"date":null,"department":null,"logoImage":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stratos-logos/logos/HyperBikes.jpeg","name":null,"response":"\nHi, thank you so much for the review and feedback on the 29\" Explorer.

However, the clamp doesn't seem right to me and looking into the bike where the seat inserts it still looks like it is missing something. But my dad got it to work for me anyways so oh well. I did attach a bike trailer to it and rode my kids around on the road no problem. Brakes seem to work well too. The wires for the brakes are very long and I will eventually end up trimming them.
